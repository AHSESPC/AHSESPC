  <h4> BOLD words</h4>
  <p>Using <strong>bold</strong> words is simple. The hard part is finding where to use them. bold words are best used when putting emphasis on certain words, such as when a character is yelling or and extremely improtant word comes up in instructions.</p>
  <h3> <em>EMPHASIZED</em> words </h3>
  <p>Using <em>Italisized</em> text is also simple. Italics can be used when a character is thinking, or when speaking in an odd tone or pronounciation.</p>
  <h3><span style="color:red"> Red paragraph</span></h3>
  <p> <span style="color:red"> Red text is quite eye grabbing. The color red is usually used in flags to symbolize those that died for the freedom for that conutry. It is such a common practice that red is in about 77% of the country flags on Earth. </span> </p>
  
  <p> 
  <span style="background-color:blue">Text highlighted by blue is quite hard to read. The sky is seen as the color blue due to the atmosphere scattering more blue light than any other color. This is also one of the least interesting paragraphs, so it does not need a header</span> </p>
  
  <p style="text-align:center"> This text is the <em>center</em> of attention. It has been this way since childhood, due to the number of siblings in the household. The house was a constant fight for attention, but always someone other than this paragraph prevailed. Therefore, this paragraph filled the void with attention from its classmates at school instead.</p>
